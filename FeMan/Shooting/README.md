## Goal:

The purpose of the exercise was to give us a chance to create, and to get experience writing simple Processing Programs to give practice with the language features. The assignment was to write an active Processing programs to display something of interest to me. These are not to be complex programs, but rather simple programs that do something cute, clever, interesting or have some other property that would interest a viewer.
